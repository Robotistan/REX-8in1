## Troubleshooting

- ##### If you try to upload a new sketch to your ESP32 and you get this error message “A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: Timed out… Connecting…“. It means that your ESP32 is not in flashing/uploading mode.
- ##### Hold-down the “BOOT” button in your ESP32 board

- ##### Press the “Upload” button in the Arduino IDE to upload your sketch
- ##### After you see the  “Connecting….” message in your Arduino IDE, release the finger from the “BOOT” button
