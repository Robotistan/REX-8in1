Omni wheels combines the freedom of 360 degree movement with the stability of a fixed mounting. This is achieved through a design which uses integral rollers rather than a swivel mount. 
In this way, OmniBot provides advantages such as 360Â° maneuverability, better directional control-following and precise positioning.
